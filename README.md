# Crashday 1.0/1.1/1.2 - Widescreen Fix
An ASI plugin to improve widescreen support for Crashday (2006). This fix automatically corrects the image in the game based on the aspect ratio of your monitor. Also, as a bonus, this plugin increases the drawing distance. To apply the changes, you need to increase the view range to the maximum in the game graphics settings.

## Install & usage
To make ASI plugin work in the game you need to use [ThirteenAG's Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) and put plugin files in to game directory or folders mentioned in ThirteenAG's loader. As mentioned earlier, the fix automatically makes corrections in the game, so the user does not need to configure anything on his own.
